For my game I think im going to do something similar to the racer game but instead of just moving accross the screen they can move all over and will have to pick up "food", almost like snake. For the win state I think I will have the first one to eat 5 win. Will either make two "game boards"
or set a timer and have each player go one at a time. The game functionality will be basic, but I want the game to look really really good!
